# Record Validations

Field validations are great, but sometimes we need to fire validations once the user has fulfilled all
the form values (typically just when the user hits the _submit_ button), how can we fire this kind
of validations? using the **FormValidation** **validateRecord** method.

```typescript
validateRecord(values: any): Promise<RecordValidationResult>
```

In this method we pass as arguments:

- All the record values, usually this kind of validation need access to the whole form data.

And it returns

- Wether all the associated record validations passed or failed (in case just one of the validations faield).
- A list of results including the result of firing all the record validations.

> This behavior is different to ValidateField, in validate field you get success or stops the process
> as soon as a fieldValidationField (all validations are executed sequentally), in validateRecord
> all record validations are executed in parallel and results are collected.

> You can find detailed information about this method in the [api definition](TODO link here to validateField api).

Let's get our hand wet:

We want to validate that, the user gets freeshipping if he is subscribed to _prime services_ or
if the the total amount purchase is greater thanb 30 USD.

Let's start with the following model:

```typescript
const checkoutForm = {
   subtotal:  34,
   discount: 10,
   isPrime: false,
   freeshipping: true,
  }
};
```

Let's define a Record Validator:

```javascript
const freeShippingAllowed = values => ({
  message: "Total must be greater than 30USD to get cost free shippings",
  type: "RECORD_FREE_SHIPPING",
  succeeded: isPrime || value.subtotal - value.discount >= 30
});
```

> More information about record validators in this link (TODO).

And let's define our form validation schema:

```javascript
const checkoutFormValidationSchema = {
  record: {
    freeShippingValidtion: [freeShippingAllowed]
  }
};

const checkOutFormValidation: FormValidation = createFormValidation(
  validationSchema
);
```

Now if we want fire the form record validation we only need to call:

```javascript
const result = checkOutFormValidation(checkoutForm);
console.log(result);
```

In this case it will return:

```javascript
TODO;
```

The record validation field failed, we can show a message to the user asking to subscribe to prime
servies or adding more items to his basket to get free shipping cost.

If we update the values of the form, e.g. the user has contracted _prime services_ it will return
a validation succeeded.

```typescript
checkoutForm.isPrime = true;
```

And we fire the record validation:

```javascript
const result = checkOutFormValidation(checkoutForm);
console.log(result);
```

It will return:

```javascript
TODO;
```

The record validation succeeded.
