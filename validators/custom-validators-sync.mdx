# Custom validators synchronous

Once you have checked that a given field or record validation is not available in the base or
third parties list of validators, is time to create your own validator.

## Field Validator

A field synchronous validator is just a function that expected three arguments (two of them optionals), and return
a validation result.

> What do we mean by syncrhonous? That is any validation that executes some code and returns an straightforward result,
> if your validation needs to make a request to a server, it cannot provide and straightdforward result and probably
> you will have to manage it using promises, that is an asynchronous validation and it's covered in the following
> [link](TODO).

Usually a Field Validator can be a perfect piece of code to be reused across the application and even as a library.

### Disecting a validator

Signature what is every stuff

### Learning by example

Validation IBAN prefix country only spain (ES), harcoded error message.

Let's go one step further we want to be able to customize the message, two flavours

Next step why not going more generic prefix per country, why not informed from
the app level. We can use for this customArgs

Next step error message, now we want to indicate the exact prefix that is
needed, ES6 interpolation won't work in this, fonk provides a definition to add params to the error message.

Final step, Let's step back, let's move to the point where the validator was ES, now the viewmodel has a
field that indicates you wether the wire transfer is local (assume Spain) or international, in this
case we depend on another field in the form values to enable o disable this validation, let's solve this
step by step

----> the form model

--> Sample data

--> The starting point (validator)

--> Indicating in a custom param the Id of the field in the form data (values) to compare with

--> Accesing the form values in the validation

--> How would that look in a validationSchema?

## Record Validator

Explain what is a record validator

comment here usually not meant for reuse, depend a lot on specific form field.

### Disecting a validator

Signature etc

### Learning by example

Total price, prime, discount example
