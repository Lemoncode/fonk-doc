# Validation Schema

A Validation Schema allows us to define in a declarative way, all the validations that apply
to each field of a form plus record validations in a single place.

Let's learn how it works by following an example:

We have the following form record:

```javascript
const myFormValues = {
  product: "shoes",
  discount: 5,
  price: 20,
  isPrime: false,
  freeshipping: true
};
```

And we want to set the following rules:

- Product must be a required field.
- Discount must be a required field.
- Price must be a required field.
- Freeshipping can be true if the total amount (price - discount) is
  greater than 20 USD, or if the fied _isPrime_ is true. We want to trigger
  this validation when the user hits on submit.

## Defining field validations

Let's start by defining a validation schema that includes the field valdiations:

```javascript
import { createFormValidation, Validators } from "@lemoncode/fonk";

const myValidationSchema = {
  field: {
    product: [validators.required.validator],
    discount: [validators.required.validator],
    price: [validators.required.validator]
  }
};

export const formValidation = createFormValidation(validationSchema);
```

Disecting the previous code snippet:

- We have just adeed a section into the schema called 'field'.
- Inside 'field' object we create new keys one per each field that
  we want to validate (this keys have the same name as the field we want to validate).
- Each field key will contain an array indicating the validation to be sequeantally
  executed when triggering a field validation or full form validation.
- Given that validation schema we create a **FromValidation** object using the
  **createFormValidation** factory method, this will allow us to call the **Fonk**
  engine to trigger a field, form or record validation.

## Defining record validations

TODO: Define the rule for the record validation add index to this validators

## Adding additional context information

What happens if we need to add addional context information to the validator
function, for instance passing a custom error message, we can use a longer
validator definition:

## Nested fields

What happens if we have a field like

## Next Steps

Now that we have got an idea of how it works let's check the formal definition:
