# Validators

**Fonk** isolated field and record validation into **Validators**

A validator is a function, that given an input (for instance, field name,
fieldvalue), check for a give business rule (e.g. is field a valid
email, or has been field informed), and depending on the success or not
of that validation it returns a succeed output, or a fail one (including
additional context information like the error message or validation
type applied).

For instance let's create a validator that check if a field contains no blank spaces:

```javascript
const VALIDATOR_TYPE = 'NO_SPACES';

let defaultMessage = 'String cannot contain white spaces';
export const setErrorMessage = message => (defaultMessage = message);

export const validator = (fieldValidatorArgs) => {
  const {
      value,
      // Just if we want to override the default error message
      message = defaultMessage,
    } = fieldValidatorArgs;

    // If the field is not informed, just return succeeded, this
    // case should be handle before by the required validator
    const succeeded = !value || (typeof value === 'string' && value === value.trim());

   // Return ValidationResultStructure
   // ValidationSucceeded: true / false
   // message: error message (string) can be overriden
   // type: type of validation executed (in this case NO_SPACES)
   // In this case we directly return data (sync validator),
   // we can return promises as well (async validator)
  return {
    succeeded,
    message: succeeded ? '' : (message as string),
    type: VALIDATOR_TYPE,
  };
}
```

> You can use typescript to build this validator, validators typings definitions
> are exposed by the library.

What are the advantage of Validators?

- We just isolates validation in a single function.
- These functions can be easily reused.
- These functions be easily tested.
- These functions do one thing and only one thing.
- We can create microlibraries for validators and cherry pick the ones that
  we really need in our project.

Validators can be:

- Synchronous.
- Asynchronous.

Validators can be defined:

- At field level:
- At record level:

You can find:

- A set of built-in validators in the core [**Fonk**](https://github.com/Lemoncode/fonk) library (required, minLength, maxLength, pattern, email).
- A list of microlibraries available with a range set of validators already implemented (just install the ones that you need, like a buffet style).
- If any of the built-in validators doesn't match your needs, you can build your own custom validator, and
  even publish it as a microlibrary to spread the OSS love around the world.

Enough theory, let's get started learning how to use the validators that already ships **Fonk**
library, click on this [link](/validators/builtin-validators) to get started.
