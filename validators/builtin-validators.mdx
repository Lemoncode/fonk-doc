# Built in validators

Fonk already ships a set of basic validators:

# Required

# Pattern

# MinLength

# MaxLenght

# Email

# More validators

**Fonk** only ships this minimal subset of validators to avoid adding extra weight to the library with other validators that you may not use.

If you are in the need of using / implementing other validators:

- You have a available a list microlibraries that implement a wide set of validators, allowing you to cherry pick the validators that you really
  need avoding extra weight into your application adding validators that you don't need. You can find a list of third partie validators in the
  following [link](TODO).

- You can implement your own custom validator, is quite easy, you can find instructions about how to build your own custom validation in this
  [link](TODO).
